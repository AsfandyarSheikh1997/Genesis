# Genesis Library

Java library to create Tokens with different Properties, Underlyings and Operations.

* Properties: inherent characters of a token. I.e. name, symbol, is it capped etc.
* Undelryings: Gives value to the token. Is it backed up by a commodity, Services (i.e. storage), etc.
* Operations: Actions which can be performed with the token. I.e. a transaction of value. Another example is the incentivization of a behavior. I.e. new token is mined for planting trees

The project is written with the netbeans IDE.

An example project exists, which uses this library. It is called GenesisApp. Please contact: bmark@ethz.ch if you are interested in it.
